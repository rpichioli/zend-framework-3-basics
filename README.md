# zend-framework-3-basics
The application is located at the `/src` folder.

I used the official **ZendSkeletonApplication**, installed by **composer** in the terminal. Exactly this way:
`composer create-project -s dev zendframework/skeleton-application path/to/install`

Inside the `/src` use following command to startup and execute a new local server for the app:
`php -S 0.0.0.0:8080` -t public public/index.php
